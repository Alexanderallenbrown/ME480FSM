This is the documentation for the ME480\+FSM library developed for ME480L controls laboratory. The library contains routines that help with the implimentation of finite state machines programmed on Arduino processors. The functions in the classes are built in the four block format adopted by the course. The code is available in the Arduino/\+Libraries/\+ME480\+FSM/src directory. The $\ast$.cpp files contain the actual code and the $\ast$.h files declare the class structures.\hypertarget{index_author}{}\doxysection{Author}\label{index_author}
